CODE Student Task Manager

Overview

The Student Task Manager is designed specifically for students like myself at CODE University of Applied Sciences in Berlin. This app is all about making our student life easier by organizing tasks and projects in one place.

Problem

As students, we often use multiple tools like Google Calendar for scheduling, Notion for notes, Slack for communication, and sometimes Miro and ClickUp for projects. Juggling all these platforms can be confusing and time-consuming.

Why It's Important

Having everything in one place means less time spent switching between apps and more time focusing on what's important—our learning and projects. This app aims to integrate these tools, making it easier to manage our tasks and schedules.

Goals

Centralized Hub: Bring together all the tools we use daily into one easy-to-access platform.
Seamless Integration: Link with Google Calendar and Notion so everything syncs smoothly.
Easy to Use: Create a user-friendly interface that even beginners can navigate effortlessly.

Features

Index (Dashboard)
  - Get a quick overview of your tasks, progress, priorities, recent activities, and reminders.
  - See what needs your attention at a glance.

My Lists
  - Create and manage task lists for different projects or subjects.
  - Keep everything organized and easy to find.

New Lists
  - Add new lists whenever you start a new project or need to organize tasks differently.

Completed Tasks
  - Track what you've finished and feel accomplished by reviewing your completed tasks.

Settings
  - Customize your app preferences and update your profile.
  - Manage your account settings easily.

Login
  - Secure login to keep your tasks and personal information safe.

Backend Implementation

Three Different Routes
  - Static Routes: Implemented for pages like Dashboard, My Lists, New Lists, Completed Tasks, Settings, and Login.
  - Dynamic Route: A single dynamic route /tasks/:id allows users to access different task pages using unique URLs. This route dynamically renders task details based on the task ID, demonstrating dynamic routing without a database.
